# GPU-benchmark

A Jupyter notebook for comparing my old and new GPUs for machine learning, also compares integrated graphichs.
Uses AI Benchmark to run 42 tests.  

Highly customized to my use case (my original GPU could not handle the tests so needed to be hard coded), but provides a good baseline on obtainig and visualizing results.

Uses Pandas, Seaborn, AI-Benchmark
